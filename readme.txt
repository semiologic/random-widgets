A collection of widgets to list recent posts, pages, comments, and more.


== Description ==

The Random Widgets plugin for WordPress introduces multi-use widgets that allow you to list random posts, pages, updates, comments or links.

To use the plugin, browse Appearance / Widgets, insert a Random Widget where you want it to be, and configure it as appropriate.

- When displaying random posts, pages or links, you can optionally filter the results by category or section.
- Random updates will display updated pages.
- Random comments will only display comments from public posts and pages -- fully ignoring password protected and private content.

= This post/page in widgets =

This plugin shares options with a couple of other plugins from Semiologic. They're available when editing your posts and pages, in meta boxes called "This post in widgets" and "This page in widgets."

These options allow you to configure a title and a description that are then used by Fuzzy Widgets, Random Widgets, Related Widgets, Nav Menu Widgets, Silo Widgets, and so on. They additionally allow you to exclude a post or page from all of them in one go.
